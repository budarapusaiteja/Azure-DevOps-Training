Response do's and dont's :
--it may be possible that customer may not have read the doc correctly.
=> you can also quickly copy paste this notepad into your e-mail saying. See this is what I see. 
=> This is the link where we see this information
=> you can refer to the link while I'm doing some more research and I'll get back to you.
--and that gives you that way to send that first information (IRT) to the customer with some valid link 

==> rather than just saying, OK, I'm looking into the issue and I'll get back to you. No, OK. Please don't do that. >

-----------------
Group rules tips :

--> Inform the customer that you know you whenever you try to log in with an in private window 
-- or when you sign out and sign in. 
-- That's when you're AAD token gets refreshed and the group rules applies immediately
--> Azure Active Directory can take upto 24 hours to update dynamic group membership.

-----------------------------------------

--> Azure DevOps -> Org Settings -> Permissions -> Members
if Type = group it is DevOps group , type = aad group it is Azure Active Directory group.
