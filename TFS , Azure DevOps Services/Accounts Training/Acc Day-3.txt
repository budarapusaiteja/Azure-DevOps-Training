Error Codes that are shown to the customers when they try to log in. 
Now few of the folks that you have access in the Azure DevOps organization, but when you're trying to log in, you're seeing 
401 error there, right? And sometimes you will also see 
403 - which is forbidden. 
500 - it is an internal error. Internal error might happen when the user has some problem with their accoun'
--if the account has been removed and added again in the org and things like that, you will see that 500 error and 
503 error is when the service is not working or when the service has been stopped categorically. So that is why I was trying to show you one of my organizations wher
503 - Service Unavilable
-- in external organization during migration , service might not be available
-- we can check this in

Azure DevOps Organization :
-> Organization name should not be greater than 50 chars
-> error : The specified name is reserved - the name is already taken.

 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

Scenario : when a customer wants to change/ switch a  AAD
-> Ask customer organization name
-> search in portal.microsoftgeneva.com/actions
-> Account Details
    --Account name, status, created, ID, region
    --TFS Scale unit. This is something where the production database and production service is being hosted out of right, so it created that for me and it put a note on where that org was created.
    --Org ID, Owner name, login, ID(VSid)
    --Early Adopter Stage : Not in early adopter program

 


--> Project Collection Administrator : access is required to change Azure Active Directory.

 


After changing / switch AAD :
Some users cannot access the organization, because they are not a part of new AAD
solutions :
1. adding users to new AAD.
2. connecting organization to AAD, who has microsoft id can access and user

 
------------------
1. Invited user to new AAD, user has to accept invitation via mail and switch the AAD in Azure
2. new user has been made Project Collection Administrator in org settings.
3. now the new user added all other users.
4. however we cannot add gmail account users, so mapping gmail accoutn users to microsoft accounts.

 

in general Disconnect directory will take 15mins time.
if the org has more than 3000 members then the switch directory/ Disconnect directory will take more than 45mins time
------------------

 

When a User cannot change AAD, we can do it in 
portal.microsoftgeneva.com/actions
under Account Admin - Link Account to Tenant
for this connection we need Account name, Tenant ID

my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions
manage.visualstudio.com/Subscribers

 

========================================================================================

 

Case: When a  customer cannot make a purchase in manage.visualstudio.com/Subscribers
--marketplace.visualstudio.com/acquisition
Troubleshooting :
1. go to azure portal, check if he has the subscription, or added in the subscription
    --Subscription-> IAM-> Role Assignment
