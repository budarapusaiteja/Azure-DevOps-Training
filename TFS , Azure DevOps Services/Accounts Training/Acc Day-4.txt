            GROUP RULES
Organization Settings -> Users -> Group rules
We can do two things :
1. Assign a liscense alone
2. Assign a liscense and a project both.

 

----------------

 

Adding Users :
--Before I add you guys(users) to the org,
--I should be adding you guys first to the AWSAD August website, AAD
->Azure portal -> Active Directory -> Users -> invite external users 
    -> User should accept invite request via mail.

How to check user has accepted request or not:
->Azure portal -> Active Directory -> Users -> select a user -> External user state
or
->Azure portal -> Active Directory -> Users -> mange view -> add column External user state
---------------------
How users can access the Organization in the AAD :
-> now AAD owner should create a group of users and set permissions to the group.




Groups prerequisited :
-> Contributor
-> Readers
-> Administrator
-- A user should not be in two groups.
-- Azure AD can take up to 24hrs to update dynamic group membership.
-- Dynamic group membership : 
-- Remove direct assignment
----------------
-- Your organization must be connected to AAD, then only group rules will work.
-- You must be a member of the project collection administrators group 
-- To create and Azure AD groups, you need Azure AD administrator permissions or have the directory administrator delegate
-- Azure AD changes might take up to 1 hour to be visible in Azure DevOps
------------------

How to create New Group :
-> Azure portal -> AAD -> groups -> New group 
--Group name
--Group description
--members -no members selected to add group members


--------------------

How to create new Group Rules :
How to set access for groups to Azure DevOps organization :
->Azure portal -> Active Directory -> Users -> Group rules 
	-- Azure DevOps or AAD group
	-- Access level
	-- Projects

So what? All things we have in Jarvis, we have three or four things that is related to group rules. 
One is we can process the group rules from our side also and we can check the list of group rules also.
OK. Uh, but you won't be able to see the members of that?
Ohh AAD unless the user is accepted the meeting the the invite or accept or or access


-----------------------

When a user is not able to access the azure portal/ organizaion 
- after creating group rule and given access (basic/stakeholder)
Troubleshooting :
Open Owner Azure portal 
->Azure portal -> Active Directory -> Users -> select the user -> Sign-in logs

Hi Trainers completed Day-4, 1st-Video
I have some doubts
Questions :
Other than the owner(who created AAD),What permissions are needed to add users in a AAD ?  = Project Collection Administrator
When we want to add a user to Organization , can we add a new user who is not available in current AAD ? = NO, should be a member or guest.
When we include more than 5 users in group rule as basic , for those extra members who will access organization is billable right ? Yes
