Azure DevOps Server / Team Server Architecture :

---------------------------------------
Different Versions
TFS 2010 -> till today, the architecture is same only small changes
Once you upgrade , you cannot go back.
You can directly upgrade form TFS2010 to ADS 2020 also, no need to follow step by step upgrade.

Customer asks to Install :
-> Server (90%)
-> Express edition () - can be installed on client machine also.
-- When we install 
-----------------------------------------
Core Components :
-> SQL Server
-> Microsoft IIS

Optional Components:
-> SQL Reporting Services (Depreciated from ADS 2022)
-> SharePoint(depreciated form TFS 2018 onwards)
-> Search Service.

Server to Service conversion:

Architecture :
- Both the Application tier and Data Tier hosts the Website.
Application Tier - There may be 2-3  machines hosting Application tier

- Database hosts the metadata -
In Server -> We have multiple collections -> Under each collection we have multiple project.
Configuration Database - is like a master database (project, user data) (metadata).

Once the Server is moved to Service - Then User don't have access to Organization Databases.
