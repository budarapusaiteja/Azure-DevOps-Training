SQL installation --SQL management studio
Understand different SQL features ?
How to install with named instance :
what is collation : region
SQL Services - how to manage them / changing service account / stop , restart service ?
SQL ports.
How to find which port SQL is running on / how to change ?
SQL login (windows and SQL login) - different in both / how to change / how to manage ?
SQL security (Server Roles/Database roles).
SQL backups (3 types of backup) How to take different backups ?
SQL Restore (How to restore different backups).
Database rename.
SQL SSRS & SSAS

Database properties - size / available size / size limit / growth policy
Tasks :
1. Install 2016 named and default instance on same server.
2. create a Dummy DB on SQL.
3. Take backup and restore it on the other instance.
4. SQL always on - SQL Cluster - SQL mirroring.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> For Azure devOps we need to install SQL , no other database
	When a customer wants to install some other database - it's not possible


New Hire Readiness - SQL server basic



SQL Server Installation Center :
-> Planning
-> Installation
	New SQL Server stand-alone installation or add features to an existing installtion.
-> Maintenance
-> Tools




SQL Server 2016 Setup :
Product key
License Terms
Global Rules
Product Updates
Install Setup FIles
Install Rules
Feature Selection (important)
	Database Engine Services (to host our database)
		Full-Text and Semantic Extractions for Search.
	Analysis Services 
	Reporting Services -Native (later we can add widget installations)
	--Remaining are optional
Feature Rules
Instance Configuration
	Default instace
	Named instace  (customised name)
	--You can have multiple named instaces
Server Configration
	When SQL installation completes it creates some service Accounts
		SQL Server Agent
		SQL Server Database Engine
		SQL Server Analysis Services
		SQL Full-Text Filter Demon Launcher
		SQL Server Browser
		--Any time we can change these accounts.
		Collation : (to change support languages) //mostly we go with the default
			Database Engine (OLTP)
			Analysis Services (OLAP)
Database Engine Configration
	Server Configration :
		Windows authentication mode //we always go with this.
			Add Current User (for both Database Engine Configuration and Analysis Services Configuration)
			Advance -> 
			if you don't add current user, you cannot login
			We can add multiple users - all the users in the AAD users.
		Mixed Mode (SQL Server authentication and Windows authentication)
	Data Directiories
		
	TempDB
	
	FILESTREAM
Analysis Services Configration
Reporting Services Configration
	
Feature Configration Rules
	Select Install only

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


OLTP - Online Transaction Processing
	user registration
		Named
		No
		Address
		email
	Structured data
	Relational Schema - Normalized (unique)   |  non-normalized (redundent)
OLAP - Online Analytical Processing
	Mostly related to 
	Analysis algorithm on OLTP data
	Data analytics
	Data mining , Extraction techniques.
	Unstructured data

-> Online relational Schema - it is a structured data
-> SA (sql account)
	 with this account we can login to sql server.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> Service Account             |              User Account
if AAD admin add Login as Service to a user account , then the account will become Service account.
if AAD admin add Login as user(allow logon locally), then account will become User account
Service Account never expires
User Account - we can set limit for 30 days or 90 days to expire user password.
	we can set group(users) policy for password expiry
we can use user account as a Service account

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After Installation :

Program files -> SQL Server -> SQL 2016 Server Managemant Studio
	SSMS-Setup-ENU

run -> services.msu

To update Service account passwords :
	SQL Server 2016 Configration Manager(Local)
	

Database :
Mirroring : exact copy of data
	pull
	push
	typically used for disaster recovery management
	At a time we cannot work on two databases
Replicating : from primary to secondary
	pull
	push :push changes 
	app can use both the databases, parallell we can update in both the databases.

SQL Server 2016
Reporting Services Configuration Manager :

Service Account
Web Service URL (used by the API's)
Database
	create a new report server database. -empty database
		current user - Intergrated sercurity.
		Database Name - ReportServer
		Temp Database Name - ReportServerTemp
		Authentication Type - Service credentials / WIndows credentials
	choose an existing report server database. - with previous data.
Web Portal URL 
Email Settings
Execution Account
Encryption Keys
Subscription Settings
Scale-out Deployment
Power BI Integration


IIS will go through HTTP.SYS and come from HTTP.SYS
HTTP:SYS is the core component of windows , it is inbuilt available 
WebService URL - Web root directory
Report Manager URL - UI reports.

Configure SSRS 
	- Reporting services
	- SajanReportServer
	- SaranServertempdb
	- Configure Web URLS
	- Create a Datasource pointing to a test database in SQL
	- Take encryption key backup
	- Exchange the database.
