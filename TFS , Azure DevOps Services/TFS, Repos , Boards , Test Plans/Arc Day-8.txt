

Reporting is a optional feature in Azure DevOPs.
This is report -> In Azure DevOps Server Administration Console
in 2022 Azure DevOps Server report is not available.

-> While creating a workitem , we can define it will go to reporting or not.

SQL Server Reporting Services
-> It is for the project manager to check the status of the project.
	only of the monitoring, we cannot perform anything from here


Go to SQL Management studiod
-> connect to analysis services , check collection analysis DB
-> check , collection warehouse DB


go to the url : localhost/TeamFoundation/Administration/v3.0/WarehouseControlService.asmx
check - getProcessingStatus  - xml file  
in this we can check , the job is started or not (job status)
	Warehouse
	Full Analysis DB -(it will pull all the data)
	Incremental Analysis DB -(it will  pull only the new data)


-> Reports come from warehouse and analysis
Q - when we cannot see any data in the reporting server url : then we need to re run the job and refresh this xml page
=> when we make some changes in the reports / when we run a job again,
	then in this xml file the last run should be update (refresh)
