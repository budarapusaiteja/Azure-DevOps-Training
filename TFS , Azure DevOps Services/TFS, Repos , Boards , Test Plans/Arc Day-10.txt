

Azure DevOps Boards / Repos | Azure Lab Service / DevTest Labs / DevBox.

1. Team Project -> folders in Process Template
	-> Menus
	-> Groups & Permissions will be set
	-> all the team project creating templates come from these folders.
	
Creating Team Project 
	from Visusl studio
		the target version of TFS must match with VS version
		eg : TFS 2015 = VS 2015
		
	from web
		introduced from 2017



Two ways :
1. Process - Inheritance
	you can't customize at a parent level
	to 
	-- We can switch process of the team projects in Inheritance
		eg : Inheritance-1 has tp1 and tp2    || Inheritance-2 has tpa and tpb
		we can switch the process of tpa to tp1.  (now tpa link with inheritance-1)
2. Process template - XML | HOst   
	Build
	Classification
	Groups and Permissions
	Lab
	Report
	Test Management
	Version control
	Wotkitem Tracking
		LInk Types
		TypeDefinitions -(the xml file which has the default options is the definition)
	ProcessTemplate.xml
	
When we create a new workitem in a organization - the id is incremental for all workitem through out organization

In xml files - There are two types of fields
	System - system.         eg : title , created by(automatically pickey by fields)
	User defined - Microsoft.    ;     end user created
	
=> When you go to Org settings in ADO dev.azure.com
	under Boards -> Process -> if you see Process Templates and import process option
	-When tfs to Dev.azure migration happens , you can see these options.
	
How to customize these Process templates in dev.azure -> click on ... and export.

Visual studio -> Process template editor extension
	with this we can get the option to edit process template in VS -> tools -> Process editor.
	
Team -> Team project collection settings -> process template manager -> select a process template -> download
	this is same as the export option in the dev.azure



When we want to make some changes to xml - export it - make some changes - 	import it.
1. download the team project 
2. edit the xml file - some name and guild
3. change the folder name and zip it
4. now import this folder from dev.azure org settings boards process.


When we cannot see some zip files , whil importing - this is VS cache issue
	disconnect the server and connect
error : "Project creation Plugins" could not be connected
	we will get this error - when we try to connect a 2019 vs process template to vs 2015
	

Workitems are different based  on the project type.
In CMMI requirement is all.
In Agile requirement is User story
In Scrum requirement is product backlog items	
	
1. Took a copy of task.xml
2. Renamed WorkitemType tag and WorkitemtypeRefname
3. Adding the field Remarks under <FIELDS> section
4. Added Remarks to the <FORM>
5. Add remarks field reference under <WEBlayout>
