1. How to check , the user is owner or a member of a organization
	ADo -> Profile -> last option -> we can see all the AAD's and organization (owner or a member)
	with the same email id - but when you want to change AAD , we need to login again
	
2. When a customer asks, that my org is working fine in ADService, not working in Azure DevOps server
	then check the Azure devops service network logs and find the 
	year, month, date of service () and sprint - you will know which service version the organization is present.
	Then suggest the related version to install on the server.
	
3. can we make the customer server / org move to service 
	is only possible to the newer versions of server - only above 2020 versions
	for older versions , upgrade to the newer versions and then migration is possible

Introduction to Azure Boards :

Azure Boards is a service for managing the 
work for your software projects. Teams need 
tools that flex and grow. Azure Boards does 
just that, brining you a rich set of capabilities 
including native support for Scrum and 
Kanban, customizable dashboards, and 
integrated reporting. 

With the Azure Boards web service, teams 
can manage their software projects. It 
provides a rich set of capabilities including 
native support for Scrum and Kanban, 
customizable dashboards, and integrated 
reporting. These tools can scale as your 
business grows. 

Core Features :

Process (Or Process templates) 
Workitems 
Workitem queries 
Boards 
Backlogs 
Dashboards 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Process Guidance : CMMI     AGILE       SCRUM
	these are the processes - CMMI     AGILE 	SCRUM
Organization settings -> Boards - Process :
	lock symbol - they cannot be customized - Agile , Scrum , CMMI
		Options availble - New team project , create inherited process , set as default process , Disable process , security
		drop down proccess
		for these processes options avaiable - New team project , Edit , Create copy of process , set as default process , disable process , security
-> You can't just go ahead and edit them. Just to edit them, you need to inherit the core template.
Process(Agile)	-> Inheritance based - copy (there exists are loose relation b/w Agile and inherited copy) -> edit
If we copied 100 projects and want to add a new feature to all of them ,
		when we add a new feature in the Parent Agile, it will be reflected in all the copied processes.

-> When we want to change/move process to another we can do it Select a process - right last option number - (Work item types , Backlog levels , Projects) -> projects 
	vertical ... -> Change process -> Select a target proces 
	when we make a change , we need to be cautious - if the target process is a different one - all the previous data will be lost.

-> Process is just as a placeholder. It's just a placeholder where it provides some files for you - For customization perspective

Process template :
Organization settings -> Boards - Process :	
	</> symbol - these are XML based (hosted xml based)process templaes , we can customize by exporting the process templates.
		Options avaiable - Clone process to inherited , enable process , Export .
-> Process(Agile) -> Export (there exists no relation b/w Agile and exported) -> edit.
If we exported 100 projects and want to add a new feature to all of them ,
	we need to add the new feature to all the 100 exported projects individually

Process template folder - when we export process template and extract , you can see these folders
Build 
	build.xml - contains permissions - Readers, contributor 
Classification 
Groups and Permissions 
Lab 
Reports 
Test Management 
Version Control 
Workltem Tracking 
ProcessTemplate.xml -process template dot XML file have all the references to the other folders


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Process TEMPLATE :

-> A model gives us an understanding of discrete elements in our organizations and helps 
us formulate language and discussion of what needs to be improved and how such 
improvement might be achieved. A model offers the following benefits: 

-> provides a common framework and language to help communicate 

-> leverages years of experience 

-> helps users keep the big picture in mind while focusing specifically on improvement 

-> is often supported by trainers and consultants 

-> can provide a standard to help solve disagreements 


Types of Process Templates :

1. Hosted XML :
• XML based structured definitions and can be customized by modifying the XML definitions 
• YOU can use WITadmin command line interface for managing workitems 
	we can't switch the Process templates in team projects
	
2. Inherited Process Model :
• This model supports customization of projects through a UI editor. 
• No WITadmin command line interface. 
	When you make changes to the parent process template, those changes will reflect in child process templates
	we can switch Process templates in team projects.

SCRUM

->Scrum is a framework within which people can address 
complex adaptive problems, while productively and 
creatively delivering products of the highest possible value. 

->Scrum itself is a simple framework for effective team 
collaboration on complex products. 

->Scrum co-creators have written The Scrum Guide to explain 
Scrum clearly and succinctly. This Guide contains the 
definition of Scrum. This definition consists of Scrum's roles, 
events, artifacts, and the rules that bind them together. 

->Scrum is: Lightweight, Simple to understand, Difficult to 
master

Process :A process defines the building blocks of the 
work item tracking system and supports the 
Inheritance process model for Azure Boards. 
This model supports customization of projects 
through a WYSIWYG user interface. 

Process template : defines the building blocks 
of the work item tracking system as well as 
other sub-systems you access through Azure 
Boards or an on-premises Azure DevOps Server 
or Team Foundation Server (TFS). It supports 
Hosted XML and On-premises XML process 
models which support customization of 
Projects through the modification and import

Team projects we have integration with - Sharepoint , SQL reporting services ,
	there are few resources in SSRS shows about team project.
	
When we create team project in TFS via web - it will not directly integrate with Reporting services and Sharepoint ,
we need to do integration manually

Creating Team project via Visual studio takes more time - due to integration with SSRS and sharepoint

-> In SSRS All the reports will be of 1 format that is RDL files(Report definition language)
	This RDL files query the internal DB's. It could be analysis SSAS or any relational schema  -
	(based upon it will show the data in pictorial format or a graphs)
	
-> TFS version and Visual studio version must match


-> Difference between TFS group and AAD group, 
	TFS group is that you can create directly in TFS and 
	AAD group is Active Directory group that is going to be added to TFS.
	TFS group by default - Project administrator , Builders, Team Foundation administrators - will be created by your TFS.
	
=> How to create Process template ?
	download - organization settings -> Process -> angular braces process templates
	
=> How do we get the angular braces process templates and import process option ?
	when TFS collection migrated from TFS to Azure DevOps Services, we will get those options.
