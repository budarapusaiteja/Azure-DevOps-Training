Azure DevOps Server Installation & Configuration 



Server OS :
-> TFS Standard (we can install on both the server os and client os)
	and we can use all the featuers

	TFS Express can be installed along with SQL express.
-> TFS Standard - supports limited featuers
	Version control, Work item , Build agent.
-> TFS Proxy Server



For all the Azure DevOps and previos TFS servers :
Upgrade lifecycle
-> 5years is the main stream supports
	we will give all the support all the bug fixes
=> After 5 years - it is the best one
	if the customer want to fix a bug, then we recommend to use new versions
-> right now 2010,2012 are out of support, some other servers are under extended service



Work group   vs   Domain 
Windows properties -> workgroup (with in a machine)
Domain :	workgroup resource access is restricted to theat machine
Azure active directory -> Domain controler -> controlling machines.
Domain - group of devices connected to a AAD azure active directory
